              Contracts between War Portal and you and your game are void if
              characters do not follow the storyline provided by the War Portal
              Universe. Contracts paid are final unless agreed by War Portal and
              contract. You may upgrade a character contract to create new
              content with War Portal with new stories and even characters, but
              that is reserved for the Tier 1 packages. Brand identity and the
              associations with the characters are important and what makes this
              a great opportunity for indies. Key defining traits that are
              inconsistent in games cause loss of retention and recognition.
              Tier two packages are intended to save indie creators the most
              money, but with the least flexibility. We provide a growing number
              of characters and story that is increasingly more engaging on
              advertising platforms, valuable for an indie to start monetizing
              their projects and abilities.

              Tier 2 contracts are meant to be highly approachable with the
              lowest cost possible to access character plot and engaging visuals
              for your game. Marketing is set to benefit the Trademark and
              licensed characters which may or may not benefit your independent
              game. Though we have good impressions, a game's success is always
              multifaceted. Check our resourced tab for independent marketing.
